### Hi there 👋
- 🏔️ I'm Philipp, an Austrian process engineering student
- 🇩🇰 I just arrived back to my home university TU Wien after an exchange at DTU in Denmark
- 💻 I'm interested in modeling, simulating and controlling fermentation based processes and plants
- 🐍 I'm hoping to deepen my knowledge in python as a tool to handle these processes in a smart way
- 🏄 About me: I like to try out new sports, like this summer with surfing 
- 🦩 Fun fact: Flamingos can fly as fast as 56 km/h
